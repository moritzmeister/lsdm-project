/**
 * SPEEDFINE CLASS
 *
 * This class is a datatype used to generate the tuple
 * related to fines emitted if the car run faster then
 * 90 KM/h.
 *
 * Output File: "speedfines.csv"
 *
 * 1: Time, in seconds identifying the time at which the position event was emitted. Using Long since in reality a data
 * stream is infinite
 * 2: VID, a string that identifies the vehicle.
 * 3: Speed, an integer that represents the speed mph (miles per hour) of the vehicle (0-100).
 * 4: XWay, an integer identifying the highway from which the position report is emitted (0...Lâˆ’1).
 * 5: Lane, an integer identifying the lane of the highway from which the position report is emitted (0...4).
 * 6: Dir, an integer identifying the direction (0 for Eastbound and 1 for Westbound) the vehicle is traveling.
