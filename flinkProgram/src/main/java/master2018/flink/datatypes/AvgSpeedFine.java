/**
 * AVGSPEEDFINE CLASS
 *
 * This class is a datatype used to generate the tuple
 * related to fines emitted if the car runs faster than 60 mph between the highway segments 52 and 56.
 *
 * Output File: "avgspeedfines.csv"
 *
 * 0: Time, in seconds identifying the first time at which the position event was emitted when checking the average
 * speed in the said highway part. Using Long since in reality a data stream is infinite.
 * 1: Time, in seconds identifying the last time at which the position event was emitted when checking the average
 * speed in the said highway part.
 * 2: VID, a string that identifies the vehicle.
 * 3: XWay, an integer identifying the highway from which the position report is emitted (0...Lâˆ’1).
 * 4: Dir, an integer identifying the direction (0 for Eastbound and 1 for Westbound) the vehicle is traveling.
 * 5: Average Speed, an integer that represents the speed mph (miles per hour) of the vehicle (0-100).
