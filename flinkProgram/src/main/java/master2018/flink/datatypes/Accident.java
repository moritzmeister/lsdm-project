/**
 * ACCIDENT CLASS
 *
 * This class is a datatype used to generate the tuple
 * related to an accident. If an accident occurs a tuple
 * is generated, ready to be written.
 *
 * Output File: "accidents.csv"
 *
 * 1: Time1, in seconds identifying the time at which the position event was emitted. Using Long since in reality a data
 * stream is infinite. It comes from the first event.
 * 2: Time2, in seconds identifying the time at which the position event was emitted. Using Long since in reality a data
 * stream is infinite. It comes from the fourth event.
 * 3: VID, a string that identifies the vehicle.
 * 4: XWay, an integer identifying the highway from which the position report is emitted (0...Lâˆ’1).
 * 5: Seg, an integer identifying the segment from which the position report is emitted (0...99).
 * 6: Dir, an integer identifying the direction (0 for Eastbound and 1 for Westbound) the vehicle is traveling.
 * 7: Pos, an integer identifying the horizontal position of the vehicle as the number of meters from the westernmost
 * point on the highway (i.e., Pos = x, 0...527999)
